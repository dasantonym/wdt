BADco. Whatever Dance Toolbox
===

This is a rewrite of the Whatever Dance Toolbox using [node-gstreamer-superficial](https://github.com/dturing/node-gstreamer-superficial), [ppgst](https://github.com/dturing/ppgst), [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and [angular.js](http://angularjs.org/).

The original 1.0 version uses [haXe](http://haxe.org)/[xinf](http://xinf.org) and became unmaintainable. It is available as a Linux LiveCD that works on PC (and some Macs) only with firewire cameras - on <http://badco.hr/works/whatever-toolbox/>.

This version, very much a work in progress, leverages some new techologies with the aim to have an easily installable application for Linux and OSX.
