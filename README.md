BADco. Whatever Dance Toolbox
===

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dasantonym/wdt/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dasantonym/wdt)

This is a re-rewrite of the Daniel Turing's [Whatever Dance Toolbox](https://github.com/danturing/wdt) using a modified fork of [node-opencv](https://github.com/dasantonym/node-opencv), [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and [angular.js](http://angularjs.org/).

The previous node-webkit based version (1.9) was dependent on GStreamer and the functionality from [ppgst](https://github.com/danturing/ppgst) was moved and ported to node.

The original 1.0 version uses [haXe](http://haxe.org)/[xinf](http://xinf.org) and became unmaintainable. It is available as a Linux LiveCD that works on PC (and some Macs) only with firewire cameras - on <http://badco.hr/works/whatever-toolbox/>.

This version, very much a work in progress, leverages some new techologies with the aim to have an easily installable application for Linux, Mac OS and Windows.
