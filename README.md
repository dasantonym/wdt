BADco. Whatever Dance Toolbox
===

This is a rewrite of the Whatever Dance Toolbox using node-gstreamer-superficial, ppgst, node-webkit and angular.js.

The original 1.0 version uses haXe/xinf and became unmaintainable. It is available as a Linux LiveCD that works on PC (and some Macs) only with firewire camerase.

This version, very much a work in progress, leverages some new techologies with the aim to have an easily installable application for Linux and OSX.
